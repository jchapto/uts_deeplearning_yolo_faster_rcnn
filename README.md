These notebooks are about computer vision, which consists of using computers to identify people and objects in videos or images. More specifically, these notebooks are about image classification and object detection, which are two computer vision techniques. Image classification consists of allocating a label to an image. For example, allocating the label “cat” to a picture that has a cat in it. On the other hand, object detection consists of detecting the location of a particular object within an image. For example, doing object detection in an image that has two dogs and three cats would draw a bounding box with the corresponding label (“cat” or “dog”) to each cat and each dog, showing its location in the image. In order to perform image classification, the baseline architecture used will be Resnet 50, which is a convolutional neural network of 50 layers. On the other hand, in order to perform object detection, the methods used will be yolov5 and fasterRCNN.
